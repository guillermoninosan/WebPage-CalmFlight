                <p class="text-slate-400 mt-4 text-lg">
                    Oxygen masks are a safety backup for rare cabin pressure changes. Knowing the mechanics behind them—like why the bag doesn't inflate—can make the moment feel far less scary.
                </p>
            </header>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p>
                    Commercial aircraft cabins are pressurized to make high-altitude flight comfortable. If that pressure drops too
                    quickly (a "decompression"), oxygen masks deploy automatically. This allows passengers to breathe normally while the pilots perform a controlled descent to a safe altitude where the air is naturally breathable.
                </p>

                <h2>What triggers the "Rubber Jungle"</h2>
                <p>
                    Pilots and flight attendants jokingly call it the "rubber jungle" when all the masks drop at once. It can look messy and chaotic, but it is a purely mechanical safety response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cabin has sensitive barometric sensors. If the cabin altitude climbs above roughly 14,000 feet, the panels overhead open automatically, and the masks fall. Cabin crew can also deploy them manually from the cockpit or their stations if they notice an issue first.
                </p>

                <h2>How the oxygen is created (Chemistry, not Tanks)</h2>
                <p>
                    You might wonder where the oxygen comes from. There are no heavy scuba tanks above your head. Instead, most overhead systems use a <strong>chemical oxygen generator</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a small canister containing a mixture of sodium chlorate and iron powder. When you pull the mask down, you pull a firing pin that ignites a mixture. This creates a chemical reaction that releases pure oxygen as a byproduct.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heat is normal:</strong> Because it is a chemical reaction, the canister above you will get hot. This is expected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smell is normal:</strong> You might smell a "dusty" or "metallic" burning scent (like a scorched toaster). This does not mean something is on fire; it means the oxygen is being produced correctly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why the bag does NOT inflate (The "Continuous Flow" Myth)</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the most common source of panic. You put the mask on, you breathe, but the plastic reservoir bag stays flat or looks deflated. <strong>This is completely normal.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system provides a "continuous flow" of oxygen mixed with cabin air. The bag is just a reservoir to catch any excess oxygen if you breathe out or pause. It does not need to fill up like a balloon for you to get air. As long as you have pulled the strap to start the flow, you are receiving oxygen.
                </p>

                <h2>What to do if masks appear</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pull immediately:</strong> Grab the closest mask and pull it firmly toward you. This tug helps pull the pin that starts the chemical reaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cover nose and mouth:</strong> The mask must cover both. Breathe normally—do not hyperventilate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure your own mask first:</strong> If you pass out from lack of oxygen (hypoxia), you cannot help your children or neighbors. Secure yours, then help them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Rapid Descent</h2>
                <p>
                    Once masks are deployed, the pilots will execute an "emergency descent." This can feel intense—the nose of the plane may pitch down, and you might hear the engines idle or the speed brakes deploy (a rumbling sound).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Do not panic.</strong> The pilots are not crashing; they are diving. They want to get the plane down to 10,000 feet as quickly as safely possible. At 10,000 feet, the air is thick enough to breathe without masks, and the situation is stabilized.
                </p>

                            Oxygen mask deployments are statistically very rare. Pilots and crew train for this specific scenario regularly. If the masks drop, the system is working exactly as designed to keep you safe while the pilots do their job.
